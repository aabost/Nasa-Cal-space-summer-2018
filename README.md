Created a more accurate experiment for the Brachistochrone problem( Cycloid curve ).
The research project was created on diffrent phases to reterive the time necessary for a ball to slide starting at any point on the cycloid to the end.
In theory the ball should take the same amount of time to reach the buttom of the curve with diffrent starting points on the curve.
